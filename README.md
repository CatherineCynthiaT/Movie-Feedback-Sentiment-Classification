Project Overview
This project involves developing a movie feedback sentiment classification system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The application classifies movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments, helping users quickly assess the overall sentiment of a large number of reviews. The project demonstrates the application of advanced natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment effectively and efficiently using a user-friendly interface.

Steps Followed
Environment Setup: Installed necessary Python packages, including transformers for using BERT, and gradio for building the user interface.
Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset containing movie reviews and sentiments. Preprocessed the text data by tokenizing using the BERT tokenizer and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model Integration: Fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification, utilizing Hugging Face's BERTForSequenceClassification.
Function Implementation: Developed a function to classify input movie reviews as positive or negative based on the fine-tuned BERT model.
Gradio Interface Setup: Created a Gradio interface for users to input movie reviews, run the sentiment analysis model, and display the classified output. The interface is designed for easy interaction with labeled input and output fields.
Deployment: Deployed the application as a web-based tool where users can input reviews and get real-time sentiment classification results.
Results and Evaluation
The project successfully implemented a movie feedback sentiment classification application that accurately classifies reviews as either positive or negative. The Gradio-powered interface ensures a simple and efficient user experience, making sentiment analysis accessible for various use cases such as movie review aggregation and analysis.
